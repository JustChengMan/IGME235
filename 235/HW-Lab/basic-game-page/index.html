        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Team Fortress 2 is the successor of Team Fortress Classic and is also a class-based multiplayer team shooter.<br>

            The game features nine classes which cover all the classics from the original game including the Heavy Weapons Guy, 
            the Pyro and the Spy. Each class has a different set of weapons and abilities. While the Heavy Weapons Guy has his 
            mini-gun and moves slowly over the map, the medic stays in the background and uses his healing beam to assist the 
            Heavy. If he does so long enough the medic can then trigger an Ãœbercharge which makes both targets invulnerable for 
            a few seconds. The spy is instead more of a loner and disguises himself as the enemy in order to infiltrate them and 
            make instant melee-kills.<br>

            To use all these classes the release version of the game features six maps with different gameplay modes. 
            On the remake of the TFC-map "2Fort" you play old-school CTF. On "Granary" and "Well" the teams need to 
            capture all five control points in a chain (much like in Dark Messiah of Might & Magic) in order to win. 
            "Dustbowl" and "Gravel Pit" feature assault-type gameplay were one team is placed in the offensive and the 
            other in defense. Last but not least on the map "Hydro" the teams fight over two points at one time in an attempt 
            to reach each other's main base. In April 2008, a new game mode called Payload was introduced with the map Gold Rush. 
            In payload the blue team has to push a rail kart carrying a bomb through a series of checkpoints before eventually 
            detonating it in the red teams base. The red team has to defend the checkpoints and prevent the cart from reaching the 
            end of its route within a limited time.
