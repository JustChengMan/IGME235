        Hello! I am a 2nd year Game Design and Development Student at RIT striving to become a successful game programmer and music composer. My interests are obviously games and music but I also enjoy cooking, juggling, and learning new things! Here at RIT, I am hoping to graduate with the expeirence necessary to work in the gaming industry as a lead deveolper or designer through classes and co-op/internships. At the same time, I wish to see myself produce music for games that would be wide known in the gaming community, like Megalovania by Toby Fox or the Mario Theme. In IGME 235, I see myself taking the first step in obtaining the dream career by learning the basics of web designing to help me and my resume resonate above other applicants.
